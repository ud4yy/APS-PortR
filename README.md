- **Optimization and Reliability:** Understand the integration of these elements to optimize performance and ensure reliability in Quick Commerce applications.

## Introduction to Q-Commerce

Getting products delivered within an hour of ordering was a far-fetched dream a few years ago. But this concept is now becoming part of our reality with companies like Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart, etc., introducing their own quick delivery services. This quick delivery has disrupted the existing market and created a new industry domain for itself â€“ Q-Commerce.

## How is it Different from E-Commerce?

Q-Commerce or quick commerce is an e-commerce business model driven by quick on-demand delivery; that is, the business tends to deliver the ordered items within an hour of placing the order.

The quick commerce business model combines the benefits of e-commerce (conducting trade using the internet) and the traditional shopping experience (completing trade within minutes) to create a new business model that satisfies the increasing demands for speed while buying online.
